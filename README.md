# Task Management System with Attendance Management

The Task Management System with Attendance Management Project can be accessed by 2 different roles: **Admin** and **Employee**. 

### Admin Users
Admin Users are in charge of managing the daily tasks assigned to employees. They have the privilege to access and manage all the features and functionalities of the system, including employee and admin list management. Admin users can also generate printable daily reports for tasks and attendance.

### Employee Users
Employee Users have limited permission to various features of the system. They can only manage the list of tasks assigned to them. Employees can also log their attendance online, and the system automatically computes their daily attendance duration.
